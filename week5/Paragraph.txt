I prefer full comps over style tiles during the design process. I can better visualize how everything works together when it is all set up in a mock up. It provides a more detailed visual representation that I can rearrange as I go through. I could not get by with just a style tile because my final mock up helped me visualize the actual website instead of the design componenets of the website. Each one took me roughly 30 to 45 minutes to create.
