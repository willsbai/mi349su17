		<p>

		<p>
			Hick's Law: "The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases." Shutterfly.com allows you to print your photos in a multitude of ways (i.e. print, vinyl, canvas, photobooks, blankets, etc.) Because of all of these alternatives, the time it takes for a user to deside how to print their photos increases.

		<p>

		<p>
			Golden Ratio: "A ratio within elements of a form, such as height to width, approximating 0.618/1.6." The Yahoo! homepage is a good example of the golden ratio. The composition is well balanced between smaller and larger images and where they are placed. This provides a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing experience.

		<p>
			Chunking: "Combining information into a limited amount of chunks for easier processing and recal." The support center portion of twitter.com is a good example of chunking. It provides helpful information in different categories in order to keep things simple, organized, and easy for the user to understand.
